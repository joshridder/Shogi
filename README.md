My final project submission for CS108 was this recreation of the classic Japanese board game in Python.
I've made a few adjustments in an attempt to iron out the "just learned how to code" feel, but I've got a ways to go yet. Maybe I'll polish it more in the future.

You can play by running main.pyw or either board.pyw file directly.
